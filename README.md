# ChatGPTUtils
A collection of utility scripts &amp; code I used ChatGPT to generate.

- jpg_largefixer.py
    - Checks a specified directory and it's subdirectories for any files with the .jpg_large or .jpg_medium extension, it then changes their extensions to just .jpg.
- filedumper.py
    - Grabs every file from a specified directory, including files in subdirectories, and dumps them all into a specified destination directory. Additionally, it will prefix the filenames with the name of the directory they were originally within.
